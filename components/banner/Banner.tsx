      People always say that everything happens for a reason. That there is a
      silver lining in every thunderstorm. Four years ago, four women from four
      different backgrounds found each other under the difficult circumstances
      of the pandemic. A time where the world stopped, but our dreams continued.
      We shared a desire to create sweet treats that represent our heritage and
      culture. Our philosophy is to spread love one bite at a time. The
      inception of BOBO Bites was born from a sketch on a napkin in a home
      kitchen during the pandemic and has now materialized into our first brick
      and mortar store in Arlington. BOBO Bites strives to recreate, re-imagine,
      and redefine what bubble tea, coffee, and Vietnamese sweet treats can be.
      Come join us and be apart of the BOBO Bites family. Calling all Biters!
